## 1 - Non-Constructible Change

  Given an array of positive integers representing the values of coins in your possession, write a function that returns the minimum amount of change (the  minimum sum of money) that you  CANNOT create. The given coins can have
  any positive integer value and aren't necessarily unique (i.e., you can have multiple coins of the same value).
  
## 2 - Sorted Squared Array
  Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers that are sorted  in ascending order and returns a new array of the same length with the squares  of the original integers also sorted in ascending order.
